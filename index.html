        <h2>Sample vs Population Estimates</h2>
        <p>When we are working with data, we are often interested in the characteristics of a population. However, it is often impractical or impossible to collect data from every member of a population. Instead, we collect data from a sample of the population and use that data to make inferences about the population. </p>
        <p>For example, if we want to know the average height of all people in the world, it would be impossible to measure the height of every person. Instead, we could collect data from a sample of people and use that data to estimate the average height of the population.</p>

        <h2>Sampling Distribution</h2>
        <p>A sampling distribution is a probability distribution of a statistic based on a random sample. It is a theoretical distribution that represents the distribution of a statistic if we were to take an infinite number of samples of the same size from the same population. </p>
        <p>For example, if we were to take an infinite number of samples of size 100 from a population, the sampling distribution of the sample mean would represent the distribution of the sample means. </p>

      <h2>Sampling With/Without Replacement</h2>
      <p>When we take a sample from a population, we can either sample with replacement or without replacement. Sampling with replacement means that we replace each sample back into the population before taking the next sample. Sampling without replacement means that we do not replace each sample back into the population before taking the next sample. </p>
      <p>For example, if we have a population of 10 people and we want to take a sample of 3 people, we could either sample with replacement or without replacement. If we sample with replacement, we would take the first sample, replace it back into the population, and then take the second sample. If we sample without replacement, we would take the first sample, remove it from the population, and then take the second sample. </p>

      <h2>Central Limit Theorm</h2>
      <p>The central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger. This is true regardless of the shape of the population distribution. </p>
      <p>For example, if we take an infinite number of samples of size 100 from a population, the sampling distribution of the sample mean would represent the distribution of the sample means. </p>

    <h2>How the geniuses figured this out?</h2>
    <p>
      The probability density function (PDF) of a normal distribution is given by: <br>
\[f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}\]

The mean of the normal distribution is μ, which can be calculated as: <br>
\[\mu = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x\cdot f(x) \, dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \, dx\] 

The variance of the distribution is σ^2, and the variance of the sample mean (\(SE^2\)) is given by: <br>
\[SE^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\]

To find the standard error (\(SE\)), take the square root of \(SE^2\): <br>
\[SE = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2}{n}}\]

      <h2>Standard Error</h2>
      <p>The standard error is a measure of the variability of a statistic. It is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic. The standard error is calculated as:</p>
      <p>The standard error of the mean (SEM) is a measure of the variability or uncertainty in the sample mean of a set of data points. It quantifies how much the sample mean is likely to vary from the true population mean. In other words, it provides an estimate of the precision of the sample mean.</p>
      <p>\[\text{Standard Error} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\]</p>
      <p>The SE of the mean is often used in inferential statistics to calculate confidence intervals and to perform hypothesis testing, such as t-tests. A smaller SEM indicates a more precise estimate of the population mean, while a larger SEM suggests more variability in the sample mean.</p>

        Given a sample of 50 students' test scores with a sample mean (\(\bar{x}\)) of 75 and a sample standard deviation (\(s\)) of 10, we can calculate the standard error (\(SE\)) using the formula:

        Substituting the values, we get:

    <p>
        In a study with a sample size (\(n\)) of 100 from a population with a standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) of 5, the standard error (\(SE\)) can be calculated as:
        \[SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\]
        Substituting the values:
        \[SE = \frac{5}{\sqrt{100}} = 0.5\]
        So, the standard error of the mean is 0.5.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Problem 3: Comparing Standard Errors</strong></p>
    <p>
        For Dataset A with a sample size (\(n\)) of 30 and a standard deviation (\(s\)) of 12, the standard error (\(SE_A\)) is:
        \[SE_A = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{12}{\sqrt{30}}\]
        For Dataset B with a sample size (\(n\)) of 60 and a standard deviation (\(s\)) of 8, the standard error (\(SE_B\)) is:
        \[SE_B = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{8}{\sqrt{60}}\]
        Comparing \(SE_A\) and \(SE_B\), you can determine which dataset provides a more precise estimate of the population mean.

    <p><strong>Problem 4: Sampling Distribution and Standard Error</strong></p>
    <p>
        In a survey of 200 households, the average annual income (\(\bar{x}\)) was $50,000 with a standard deviation (\(s\)) of $10,000. To calculate the standard error (\(SE\)) of the mean for the sampling distribution, you can use the formula:
        \[SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\]
        Substituting the values:
        \[SE = \frac{10,000}{\sqrt{30}}\]
    </p>

    <p><strong>Problem 5:</strong> You are conducting a study on the heights of a certain population. Calculate the standard error of the mean for the population with a sample size of 50 and then with a sample size of 200. Discuss how the standard error changes as the sample size increases.</p>

    <p>Solution: The standard error of the mean (\(SE\)) can be calculated using the formula:
        \[
        SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
        \]
        where:
        - \(\sigma\) is the population standard deviation.
        - \(n\) is the sample size.

        Let's calculate \(SE\) for two different sample sizes: 50 and 200.

        <p>Sample Size = 50:</p>
        - Assume the population standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) is known to be 5 inches (this is just an example value).
        - The sample size (\(n\)) is 50.
        \[
        SE_{50} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{50}} \approx 0.707
        \]

        <p>Sample Size = 200:</p>
        - Using the same population standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) of 5 inches.
        - The sample size (\(n\)) is 200.
        \[
        SE_{200} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{200}} \approx 0.354
        \]

        <p>Discussion:</p> As observed from the calculations, the standard error (\(SE\)) decreases as the sample size increases. With a larger sample size (200), the standard error is smaller (0.354) compared to the standard error with a smaller sample size (50, where \(SE\) is 0.707). A smaller standard error implies a more precise estimate of the population mean. This aligns with the Central Limit Theorem, where larger sample sizes lead to more accurate estimates of population parameters, making researchers prefer larger samples for more reliable and precise results.
